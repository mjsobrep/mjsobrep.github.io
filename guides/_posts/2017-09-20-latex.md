## Exporting LaTeX as plain text
Sometimes you need your latex as plain text to copy and paste into online forms and the like. Doing it this way will bring all of your refs and what not correctly. I would recomend turning off page numbers, headers, footers, etc before doing this. 

You can convert a pdf to plaintext by using pdftotext `pdftotext <target>.pdf` which generates `<target>.txt` using the `-raw` option might be useuful for tables and the like

## Compressing PDFs
When you compile with latex, the result will have whatever images you included in it. They may be really big. Ther are ways to use the image scale argument in LaTeX, but that is clunky. A better way is to shrink the PDF after it is compiled. Ghostscript can help:

`gs -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dBATCH -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=out.pdf in.pdf`

You can change `-dPDFSETTINGS` to `/default` if you want a huge file (almost the same as what LaTeX uses) or to `/printer` if you want something a bit smaller. The other options start to get too small

## Bringing PDFs to to other image types:
`for f in *.pdf; do pdftocairo -png -r '600' -transp "$f" "$f.png"; done`
