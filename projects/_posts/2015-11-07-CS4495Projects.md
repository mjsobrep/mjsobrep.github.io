summary: I am taking a class in computer vision, here are links to my projects

I am currently taking a class in [Computer Vision](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~hays/compvision/) from [James Hays](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~hays/) at Georgia Tech. He posts all of our projects (which is awesome). Rather than figuring out how to port them over to my website (which could be tough with the way I have it set up) and having to deal with the large extra load of files, I will just link to where he has them posted.

### [Project 1: Image Filtering and Hybrid Images](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~hays/compvision/results/proj1/msobrepera3/index.html)

### [Project 2: Feature detection and matching](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~hays/compvision/results/proj2/msobrepera3/index.html)

### [Project 3: Camera Calibration and Fundamental Matrix Estimation with RANSAC](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~hays/compvision/results/proj3/msobrepera3/index.html)

### [Project 4: Scene recognition with bag of words](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~hays/compvision/results/proj4/msobrepera3/index.html)
