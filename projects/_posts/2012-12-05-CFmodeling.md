summary: Modeling Cystic Fibrosis and how it responds to treatments
---
As part of the first group based class within the BME curriculum at Georgia Tech, we were asked to expand upon a model provided to us of Cystic Fibrosis to evaluate the effects of various treatments. It was recommended that we use PLAS, a relatively underpowered tool used in the systems biology world. Instead, we chose to use MatLab. However, running simulations and interpreting the results from MatLab proved difficult for a number of team members. So I decided that it would be best to make a tool that would allow us to easily adjust parameters of simulations and view the results. The Cystic Fibrosis Modeling Suite was born.
