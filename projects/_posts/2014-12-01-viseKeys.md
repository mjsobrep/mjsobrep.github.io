summary: Some vise keys I designed and machined
---
The nice Kurt vises in the machine shop which I used to run needed some keys put in. Rather than ordering them, I figured it would be fun to make some. So that is what I did. They really weren't as close to tolerance as I would have liked for their usage, but such is life with a hybrid mill, aluminum, and questionable tooling. They sure do look good though, gotta love a sweet chamfer tool. After watching the work of the highly talented Mike Haggerty, I am totally convinced that almost everything should just be chamfered on the machine.
