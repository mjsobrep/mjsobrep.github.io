summary: A jig I helped a student in the BioID program design and machine
---
One of the BioID students needed a jig to bend wire for some research he was doing. Unfortunately, time was short as it was the end of the semester; so I ended up fabricating the part for him instead of teaching him how to do it. We worked together on the design, then I machined it, trying to explain what I was doing as I went.
