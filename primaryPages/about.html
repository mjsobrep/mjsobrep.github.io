<h2>Where I am Now</h2> 
<p>I am currently doing a PhD at Penn in the Rehab Robotics Lab, part of the GRASP Lab. I live in Philly with my [fiancé](http://stephmd.com/), our dog [Abita](https://www.facebook.com/AbitaTheGolden/), and our cat Diana. </p> 

<h2>Where I am Going</h2> 
<p> 
My goal long term is to stay in academia doing research and teaching as a professor. I really want to have the academic freedom afforded by academia and to be on the cutting edge of technology. I also really enjoy teaching. So on whole, this seems like a great route for me. Eventually I hope to be able to collaborate across the spectrum with other researchers and industrial partners.

<h2>My Interests</h2> 
<p>Currently, my primary interest is in robotics. Robotics is of course incredibly broad, but in general requires a synthesis of mechanics, algorithms, computation, advanced models, etc... The complexity of bringing these elements together is fascinating to me. For a long time, my primary interests laid in medical device design and manufacture along with Health IT. My research blends these two interests together. I am working to understand how social robots can be used in telepresence rehab interactions. Down the road, I would like to broaden back out and look at robots in manufacturing and space as well. I find I am generally most interested in how robots interact with people, which is going to become more relevant, in more fields, over the coming years.</p> 

<h2>Some About My Past</h2> 
<p>I was born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana. I went to Trinity Episcopal School from 2nd through 7th grade and then Jesuit High School for 8th grade. My family moved to Acworth, Georgia right before I started High School. I attended Kennesaw Mountain High School, where I was very active in the student Government. I then studied Chemical Engineering for a year at Auburn University before transferring to Georgia Tech in the fall of 2012. I graduated from Georgia Tech with a Bachelor’s of Science in Biomedical Engineering and a minor in Computer Science. I then spent some time working at Georgia Tech in the IRIM Tech Transition Lab.</p> 

<h2>Hobbies</h2> 
<p>I love sailing, which I currently do at [Liberty Sailing Club](https://libertysailing.clubexpress.com/) and live music. I also love creating, that can be designing and building something from metal or wood, writing code, or cooking (I am up to 3 grills and a smoker).</p>
