<h3>Where I am now</h3>
<p>I am a student at Georgia Tech, majoring in Biomedical Engineering with a Minor in Computer Science (focused on Intelligence) and planning to graduate in December of 2015. At the moment I am working at Eli Lilly in Indianapolis. I am in the corporate consulting group working on Automation and Controls work.</p>

<h3>My Interests</h3>
<p>Currently, my primary interest is in robotics. Robotics is of course incredibly broad, but in general requires a synthesis of mechanics, algorithms, computation, advanced models, etc... The complexity of bringing these elements together is fascinating to me. For a long time my primary interests laid in medical device design and manufacture along with Health IT. I am excited to find ways to blend robotics with into all of its potential applications, including health care. Across nearly every sector, the growing field of robotics is going to be a game changer. From menial factory work that has prior to now been cost prohibitive to automate, to space exploration that used to be only in the reach of large governments, to elderly care where we have more demand than capacity and health care where more and more complicated procedures and treatments necessitate automation.</p>

<h3>Some About My Past</h3>
<p>I was born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana. I went to Trinity Episcopal School from 2nd through 7th grade and then Jesuit High School for 8th grade. My family moved to Acworth, Georgia right before I started High School. I attended Kennesaw Mountain High School, where I was very active in the student Government. I then studied Chemical Engineering for a year at Auburn University before transferring to Georgia Tech in the fall of 2012.</p>

<h3>Hobbies</h3>
<p>I love sailing (although I no longer have a sailboat) and live music. I also love creating stuff, that can be designing and building something from metal or wood or writing code. I also enjoy cooking and obviously eating (who doesn't). Lately I have also been getting back into rock climbing.</p>
