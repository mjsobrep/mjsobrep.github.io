For our senior Design Project, Maria Diaz Ortiz, Kathryn Murray, Grant Stearns, and I evaluated the need for a new device to treat intussusception. We then went through multiple iterations of developing the device.

For a broad overview of the project, take a look at this presentation and graphic developed by, respectively, Kathryn Murray and Maria Diaz Ortiz.
