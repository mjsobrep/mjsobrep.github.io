<p>As a final project for our intro to robotics class at Georgia Tech, we were required to use a Scribbler robot for visual servoing. The goal was to park the robot one foot in front of the square on the wall. Alexa Siu and I worked on the project together and decided to use an image based technique (versus a positional technique). We were relatively pleased with the outcome. </p>.
