summary: A fixture which I designed and machined for a lab at GT
---
I redesigned a fixture to load heart tissue for Dr. Sun's lab at Georgia Tech. The fixture needed to be rigid, repeatable, and adjustable. The assembly includes 5 major components, a base plate and four identical mounts for actuators. The mounts can be indexed along the plate at repeatable steps. The lab was very pleased with the result.
