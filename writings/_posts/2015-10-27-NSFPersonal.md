This is the personal statement which I submitted this year for the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program. The only change from the actual submission is the addition of the header and footer. The statement talks about my background, why I want to pursue a PhD, why I think I am qualified to pursue a PhD, and what impact I think I can have.
